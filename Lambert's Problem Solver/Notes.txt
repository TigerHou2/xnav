Attempts:

- Orbit Rotation Match
	- Find orbit in absolute frame, get three positions corresponding to the three velocities
	- Iterate through sets of three points to check if a single rotation + translation can match those points to the positions
		- Sub-attempt: 
			- eliminate sets first by checking eccentricity
			- failed because three points cannot uniquely define an ellipse
		- Sub-attempt: 
			- select one position, convert remaining two positions to be relative to the first
			- select a point from the corresponding set, and search for valid candidate points at proper position in remaining two sets
				- search within a radius in the 2nd set (because rotation is unknown). Then search in a fixed direction in the third set.
